# Machine Learning Service Examples
Included here are a set of examples meant to get you up and running with the Machine Learning Service built into Squirro version `2.6+`.

## Installing Jupyter

The walkthroughs for the Machine Learning Service are built as [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/), and require jupyter to be installed:

```bash
$ pip install jupyter
```

as well as the [Squirro toolbox](https://squirro.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DOC/pages/159809602/Install+Squirro+Toolbox+on+Python)

Once everything is installed, you can start a notebook by running:

```bash
$ jupyter-notebook
```
